## Hi there, I am Prem B RanaðŸ‘‹
I currently serve as the mentor for Slipper2sat's Earthquake Precursor Detection Mission (EPDM), which aims to advance the prediction of earthquake precursors by integrating Quad-mag technology and noise-reduced techniques to analyze electromagnetic wave patterns. Utilizing 1U boomless CubeSat technology, we focus on detecting anomalies in Earth's magnetic field by monitoring Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) signals that may precede seismic events. In addition to my work in EPDM.

I have led a project focused on the recognition and separation of fresh and rotten fruits using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. This project was a pivotal experience, combining my passion for technology with practical problem-solving in machine learning and web technologies.
I am intrested in AI/ML, signal processing and web development
